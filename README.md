# MaskDetection  😷

## [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

 * Train a computer to recognize your own images, sounds, & poses. 📷 🔉 🧘

 * A fast, easy way to create machine learning models for your sites, apps, and more – no expertise or coding required

### How do I use it?

#### 1. Gather 

 * Gather and group your examples into classes, or categories, that you want the computer to learn.

#### 2. Train 🏋️

 * Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.

#### 3. Export

 * Export your model for your projects: sites, apps, and more.

 * You can download your model or host it online for free.Video: Export your model.
 
 * The models you make with Teachable Machine are real TensorFlow.js models that work anywhere javascript runs, so they play nice with tools like Glitch, P5.js, Node.js & more.
 
 * Plus, export to different formats to use your models elsewhere, like Coral, Arduino & more.

### Mask Detection using Live feed 🎥

  * Here I have developed an model using my own data set and deployed the model.
  
  * Once you click on the link in the about it will open a new tab.
  
  * Once it triggered it will access your camera and give the output in the % format. 
  
  * As it is live the value will change in with time. 
  
  * It can be further extendable and can be embedded to the CCTV footage from there we can easyly identify who are all not wearing the mask correctly
  
  * Have a look at the [Live face mask detection](https://albusdracosam.github.io/MaskDetection.github.io/) here.

### Instructions 📓

 * Sit in a well lit environment. 💡

 * It will take a minute to access the camera.
